# EventsRunGC

**This is a Bukkit/Spigot plugin made for 1.7.10**

Feel free to use it as you want. This an old, but very old project of mine, if I were to continue this project I'd rewrite everything first, and I don't want and don't have enough time for this.

It was made using Bukkit 1.7.10, I haven't tested it in other versions, it's unfinished and not documented, some things may not have sense. This was my first "big" project, I learned a lot by making this, even that it's not finished.

Since I won't continue this, I'm giving it to who wants to take it, if it is you, congrats and good luck if yoou want to finish. Below i have an small description of what was my intention with this plugin.

I started this plugin with the idea of a plugin that is capable of "making" lots of minigames, with lots of commom features for a plugin, such as custom commands to join/leave an event, anoucements messages, player limit, map regeneration, so you could make events were players could break/place blocks and the plugin would rebuild the map for you, and a lot more that I don't remember right now. You can take a look inside the project and try to find/undestand the plugin a bit more.

I only ask you one thing, if you use it entirely or parts of, remember who gave you this, credits don't kill anyone :)
